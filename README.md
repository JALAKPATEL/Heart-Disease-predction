# Heart-Disease-predction


==> Overview

This project implements a Heart Disease Prediction Model using the Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing medical attributes and predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on selected features.


==> Features Used

The model selects the five best features for prediction:

1. Chest Pain Type (cp)

2. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

3. ST Depression (oldpeak)

4. Number of Major Vessels (ca)

5 .Thalassemia Test Result (thal)
